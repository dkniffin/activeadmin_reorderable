## Deployment

following steps are necessary to push a new version:

### Build the gem

`gem build activeadmin_reorderable.gemspec`

This will produce an artifact named roughly
`activeadmin_reorderable-<version>.gem`.

### Publish the gem

`gem push activeadmin_reorderable-<version>.gem`

You may bump into permissions issues if you have not been added as an
owner on the gem. Consult the Viget development team for acess.
